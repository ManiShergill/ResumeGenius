Resume Genius 
1. Project Setup
1.1 Project Scope
Goal: Create an AI-powered resume builder that enhances resume content and structure using NLP and ML.
Features: Resume parsing, content analysis, ATS optimization, custom recommendations, score & feedback.

1.2. Tools and Technologies selected
Frontend: React.js for building the user interface.
Backend: Node.js and Express for server-side logic.
Machine Learning: Python with libraries like scikit-learn and NLTK for NLP tasks.
Database: MongoDB for storing user data and resumes.

2. Frontend Development pick up
2.1. Set Up React Project
Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) if you havenâ€™t already.

3. Create a React app:
npx create-react-app resume-genius-frontend
cd resume-genius-frontend

4. Install required libraries:
npm install axios react-router-dom

5. Create basic components:

Home Page: Upload resume and display analysis results.
Upload Component: Form for users to upload their resumes.
Results Component: Display analysis results and recommendations.
Integrate with Backend: Use axios to send requests to your backend API.

3. Backend Development
3.1. Set Up Node.js and Express
Create a new directory for your backend:
mkdir resume-genius-backend
cd resume-genius-backend

3.2 Initialize Node.js project:
npm init -y

3.3 Install required packages:
npm install express mongoose body-parser cors

3.4 Create server:
index.js:
(javascript)
const express = require('express');
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const cors = require('cors');

const app = express();
app.use(cors());
app.use(bodyParser.json());

// Connect to MongoDB
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/resume-genius', {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
});

// Define routes here

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));

3.5 Create routes for resume upload and analysis.

4. Machine Learning Development
4.1. Set Up Python Environment
Install Python and pip (Python Package Installer).

4.2 Create a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

4.3 Install required libraries:
pip install scikit-learn nltk pandas

4.4 Develop ML models for resume analysis:
Model Training: Use scikit-learn to build and train models for keyword optimization and content analysis.
NLP Tasks: Use NLTK for text preprocessing and analysis.

5. Create a REST API in Python to interact with the ML models.

5. Integrate Components
Frontend and Backend Integration:
Configure React to call your Node.js APIs.
Implement error handling and data processing in the frontend.

Backend and ML Integration:
Set up endpoints in Node.js to handle resume uploads and analysis requests.
Use Python scripts to process the resumes and return results to the backend.

6. Testing and Deployment
6.1. Testing
Frontend Testing: Ensure all components render correctly and interact with the backend.
Backend Testing: Test API endpoints with tools like Postman.
Integration Testing: Verify end-to-end functionality of resume upload and analysis.
6.2. Deployment
Frontend: Deploy to platforms like Vercel or Netlify.
Backend: Deploy to cloud services like Heroku or AWS.
ML Model: Host the model API on a server or cloud platform.

7. Documentation
Create a detailed README.md file for your GitHub repository.
Document your code with comments and explanations.
8. Maintenance
Monitor the application for issues.
Update the models and features based on user feedback.
